Fixed all the styling for my page and got the buttons to work. Decided that I need a bigger monitor or something if I want to make my styling more user friendly in the future because the inspect option still isn't big enough for screens larger than my own. Other than responsive issues I'm really proud with how well this website is working. I like to do most of my more productive activities from 9am to 6pm so I wanted to create this app as a way to organize my personal life.
